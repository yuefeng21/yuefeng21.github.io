         I start to play piano since 4 years old, but after I got the amateur top level certificate of piano. </p>
         <p>I just quit.</p>

         I also learned painting around the same age, and explored 1 or 2 years on Sketch(素描), quick sketch(速写), Chinese Painting(Gongbi 工笔 & Xieyi 写意), Gouache(水粉), Watercolor(水彩). 
    </p>
    <p>I am still a fan of  <a href="../assets/images/Gongbi.png"> painting</a></p>
